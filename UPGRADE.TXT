MATE 1.26 to 1.28 Upgrade HOWTO
<mateslackbuilds@gmail.com>

This document explains how to upgrade from MATE 1.26 on MATE 1.28 on
Slackware Linux Current

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you begin, we strongly recommend making a backup of your system, or,
if not the entire system, at least the /etc and your home directory.  You
might find that you need to refer to a few things after the upgrade process
is complete. Back it up, or take your chances.

OK, now that everything is safely backed up, let's proceed. :-)

You will need the MATE 1.28 packages available on your local system.  Grab
them from the official repository at https://www.slackware.uk/msb/ or
any of the mirror sites.  Please note that MATE 1.28 has no new packages and 1 removed packages.

1.  Upgrade and install all new MATE 1.28 packages:

    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/deps/*.txz
    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/base/*.txz
    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/extra/*.txz

2.  Remove MSB package that are now part of Slackware:
    lxml
    It's advised to reinstall those packages from Slackware repository after removing MSB packages.

3.  Run xwmconfig and select xinitrc.mate-session. This ensures you get the
    latest copy of xinitrc.mate-session due to changes in mate-session-
    manager.  ALWAYS run this command for both new installations or upgrades
    from MATE 1.28

At this point you should be running MATE 1.28 on Slackware Current.  :-)

We wish everyone good luck with this!  Please report any issues to
