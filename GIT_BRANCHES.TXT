MATE SlackBuilds
================

MSB will follow MATE's workflow on versioning and releases as described in
MATE's wiki: http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/dev-doc.

Currently, there are three branches in the MSB GIT repository:

- master:  The MSB development branch.  It represents the most up-to-date
  code, but no regular binary packages are built from this branch.
  Building from this branch may or may not work due to the nature of changes.
  This is where the next stable release will come from.
  Please use this branch for testing only and not for production environments.

- 14.0-mate-1.6:  The MSB stable branch for Slackware 14.0. The MSB
  1.6 binary packages for Slackware 14.0 were built from this branch.
  Since Slackware 14.1 has been declared as the next stable release then
  this branch is considered obsoleted and no longer updated.

- 14.1-mate-1.6
  14.1-mate-1.8
  14.1-mate-1.10
  14.1-mate-1.12:  The MSB stable branch for Slackware 14.1.
  The MSB 1.6 binary packages for Slackware 14.1 are built from
  this branch. Since Slackware 14.2 has been released as the next stable release
  then this branch is considered obsoleted and no longer updated.

- 14.2-mate-1.14:
- 14.2-mate-1.16:
- 14.2-mate-1.18:  The MSB stable branch for Slackware 14.2.
  The MSB 1.18 binary packages for Slackware 14.2 are built from this branch.
  Since Slackware 15.0 has been released as the next stable release
  then this branch is considered obsoleted and no longer updated.

- 15.0-mate-1.28:  The MSB stable branch for Slackware 15.0
  This is the currently supported branch only receives bug fix updates.
  The MSB 1.28 binary packages for Slackware 15.0 are built from this branch.
  You might want to use this branch if you enjoy stable releases.

An easy way to find out which branch are you in right now (once you have
cloned the repo or pulled the latest updates):

$ git branch

An asterisk will appear in front of the branch you are currently in.
Example output of 'git branch':

  14.0-mate-1.6
  14.1-mate-1.6
  14.1-mate-1.8
  14.1-mate-1.10
  14.1-mate-1.12
  14.2-mate-1.14
  14.2-mate-1.16
  14.2-mate-1.18
  15.0-mate-1.26
  15.0-mate-1.28
* master

This output indicates that you are now in the 'master' branch.

To switch to another branch, use 'git checkout <branch_name>'.  Example:

$ git checkout 15.0-mate-1.28
$ git branch

  14.0-mate-1.6
  14.1-mate-1.6
  14.1-mate-1.8
  14.1-mate-1.10
  14.1-mate-1.12
  14.2-mate-1.14
  14.2-mate-1.16
  14.2-mate-1.18
  15.0-mate-1.26

You have now switched from the 'master' branch to the '15.0-mate-1.28'
branch.
